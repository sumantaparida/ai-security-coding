            Provisions regarding policy not being called into question in terms of Section 45 of the Insurance Act,
            1938, as
            amended from time to time</p>
        <p class="conditions-list-style">01. No Policy of Life Insurance shall be called in question on any ground
            whatsoever after expiry of 3 yrs from
            a. the date of issuance of policy or
            b. the date of commencement of risk or
            c. the date of revival of policy or
            d. the date of rider to the policy

            question within 3 years from
            a. the date of issuance of policy or
            b. the date of commencement of risk or
            c. the date of revival of policy or
            d. the date of rider to the policy
            whichever is later.
            For this, the insurer should communicate in writing to the insured or legal representative or nominee or
            assignees
            of insured, as applicable, mentioning the ground and materials
            on which such decision is based.</p>
        <p class="conditions-list-style">03. Fraud means any of the following acts committed by insured or by his
            agent, with the intent to deceive the
            insurer or to induce the insurer to issue a life insurance policy:
            a. The suggestion, as a fact of that which is not true and which the insured does not believe to be
            true;
            b. The active concealment of a fact by the insured having knowledge or belief of the fact;
            c. Any other act fitted to deceive; and
            d. Any such act or omission as the law specifically declares to be fraudulent.</p>
        <p class="conditions-list-style">04. Mere silence is not fraud unless, depending on circumstances of the
            case, it is the duty of the insured or his
            agent keeping silence to speak or silence is in itself equivalent to speak.</p>
        <p class="conditions-list-style">05. No Insurer shall repudiate a life insurance Policy on the ground of
            Fraud, if the Insured / beneficiary can
            prove that the misstatement was true to the best of his knowledge and there
            was no deliberate intention to suppress the fact or that such mis-statement of or suppression of
            material fact are
            within the knowledge of the insurer. Onus of disproving is upon the
            policyholder, if alive, or beneficiaries.</p>
        <p class="conditions-list-style">06. Life insurance Policy can be called in question within 3 years on the
            ground that any statement of or
            suppression of a fact material to expectancy of life of the insured was incorrectly
            made in the proposal or other document basis which policy was issued or revived or rider issued. For
            this, the
            insurer should communicate in writing to the insured or legal
            representative or nominee or assignees of insured, as applicable, mentioning the ground and materials on
            which
            decision to repudiate the policy of life insurance is based.</p>
        <p class="conditions-list-style">07. In case repudiation is on ground of mis-statement and not on fraud,
            the premium collected on policy till the
            date of repudiation shall be paid to the insured or legal representative or
            nominee or assignees of insured, within a period of 90 days from the date of repudiation.</p>
        <p class="conditions-list-style">08. Fact shall not be considered material unless it has a direct bearing
            on the risk undertaken by the insurer. The
            onus is on insurer to show that if the insurer had been aware of the said
            fact, no life insurance policy would have been issued to the insured.</p>
        <p class="conditions-list-style">09. The insurer can call for proof of age at any time if he is entitled to
            do so and no policy shall be deemed to be
            called in question merely because the terms of the policy are adjusted
            on subsequent proof of age of life insured. So, this Section will not be applicable for questioning age
            or
            adjustment based on proof of age submitted subsequently.</p>
